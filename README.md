## Overview

This repository contains the final project for Chem 361: Machine Learning in Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The project explores the use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for predicting molecular binding affinities — specifically logKd and logKi — by integrating graph-based molecular representations with tabular physicochemical descriptors.

The core idea is to model protein–ligand interactions as graphs, where atoms and bonds form nodes and edges. Using this representation, the GCN learns to capture structural and topological information relevant to binding affinity prediction.
